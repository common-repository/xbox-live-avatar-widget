== Description ==

Simple Plug-in to show your Xbox Live Avatar on your wordpress blog's sidebar :D

Upload the entire contents of the "Xbox Live Avatar"folder to /wp-content/plugins/ and activate it though your dashboard.
Then Add it to your sidebar as a widget and your good to go XD

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My Avatar displays slightly below where I expect it. Why? =

This happens because your Avatar has a transparrent background which is large enough to accomodate the tallest of Avatars.
I will hopefully provide built-in correction for this in 1.0. Failing that I will add an option for user correction in the plug-in's options.
